    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Spanish potato salad is an important dish in Spain's culinary history. </p>
    <p>There are many versions, and this is the way we like ours. Goes so well with so many things! This is good served
        warm or at room temperature.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> 1 pound small red potatoes</li>
        <li> 3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar</li>
        <li> 2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
        <li> 1 small red bell pepper, chopped</li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons pimento-stuffed green olives, sliced</li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon minced shallot</li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li> salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li> 1 lemon, cut into wedges (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h4>Step 1</h4>
            <p>Place potatoes into a pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and
                simmer until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain and cool until easily handled. Slice potatoes about
                1/2-inch thick and place in a bowl.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Step 2</h4>
            <p>Whisk olive oil and vinegar together in a bowl; stir in garlic. Pour dressing over potatoes and lightly
                toss to coat.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Step 3</h4>
            <p>Mix red bell pepper, green olives, shallot, parsley, salt, and pepper into potatoes. Serve salad with
                lemon wedges to squeeze over each serving.

            alt="Ribs">
    </div>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Tender, sweet, and sticky baby back ribs that only take 1 hour from prep to plate. If you like them with a little
        spice, add a teaspoon of cayenne pepper to the dry rub. I make this in my 8-quart Instant Pot® Duo; a 6-quart
        pot may require less liquid. </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> 2 racks baby back pork ribs</li>
        <h4>Dry Rub:</h4>
        <li> ¼ cup dark brown sugar</li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons garlic salt (such as Lawry's®)</li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons chili powder</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste (Optional)</li>
        <h4> Cooking Liquid:</h4>
        <li> 1 cup beef broth</li>
        <li> 12 fluid ounces root beer</li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon liquid smoke flavoring</li>
        <li> 1 cup barbecue sauce (such as Sweet Baby Ray's®), or more to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h4>Step 1</h4>
            <p>
                Use a butter knife to cut into an edge of the rib racks. Use a paper towel to grab and lift off the
                silvery membranes.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Step 2</h4>
            <p>
                Combine brown sugar, garlic salt, chili powder, black pepper, and cayenne pepper in bowl. Coat the ribs
                generously with the dry rub.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Step 3</h4>
            <p>
                Place the trivet inside the Instant Pot®. Pour in broth, root beer, vinegar, and liquid smoke. Place
                ribs on the trivet on their sides, with one inside the other. Close and lock the lid and make sure the
                vent is sealed. Select manual high pressure and set the timer for 30 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for
                pressure to build.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Step 4</h4>
            <p>
                Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions for 15
                minutes. Release remaining pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's
                instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Step 5</h4>
            <p>
                Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler on the highest heat
                setting. Place a rack 6 inches from the heat source.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Step 6</h4>
            <p>
                Transfer ribs to a broiling pan and generously coat with barbecue sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Step 7</h4>
            <p>
                Cook in the broiler until barbeque sauce is bubbly and caramelized, 5 to 7 minutes.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
